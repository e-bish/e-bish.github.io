## A bit about me

I graduated from the honors program at the [University of Rhode Island](https://web.uri.edu/marbio/) in 2015 with a B.S. in Marine Biology and a minor in Chemistry. As an undergrad I studied the ecology of marine macroalgae, and spent a summer in Washington to develop a [protocol](https://nwstraits.org/our-work/kelp-recovery/) for volunteers to survey kelp from kayaks. Following graduation, I returned to Washington and studied Pigeon Guillemots (*Cepphus columba*) with the [Guillemot Research Group](http://www.pigeonguillemot.org/) on Whidbey Island before settling on the Olympic Peninsula. After a year with the [Washington Conservation Corps](https://ecology.wa.gov/Local-projects-issues/Investing-in-communities/Washington-Conservation-Corps) as an Education and Outreach Assistant at the [North Olympic Salmon Coalition](https://nosc.org/), I then spent several years working as an independent contractor with local and state government agencies under my business Westward Ecology. The [Port Gamble Sâ€™Klallam Tribe](https://pgst.nsn.us/) was my primary client, and as a biologist in their Habitat Research and Monitoring Program I was a core member of the [Hood Canal Bridge Assessment Team](https://lltk.org/project/hood-canal-bridge/) organized by Long Live the Kings to examine the impact of a floating bridge on juvenile salmon migration in the Hood Canal. 


At the University of Washington [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/), I continue to explore the impacts of human modifications on marine habitats and fish ecology. I am supported with funding through Washington Sea Grant, SAFS Fellowships, a [CICOES Graduate Student Award](https://cicoes.uw.edu/education/graduate-student-awards/), and an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
